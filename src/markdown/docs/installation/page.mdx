# Installation

## 1. Install shadcn

As explained in introduction, most of these components are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn UI</a>. 

Visit <a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation' target='_blank'>shadcn installation page</a> to see how to install shadcn.

<br />

## 2. Add styling

Delete the existing styling from your project and add your <Link href='/docs/styling'>desired styling</Link> to your tailwind config.

<br />

## 3. Add components

### Shadcn components

In this docs below each component's name you'll have the shadcn docs link for that component.

<br />

e.g. You want to install shadcn button component. You'll navigate to <a target='_blank' href='/components/button'>button page</a>, click on the shadcn docs
link and install the button component like it's shown in the docs.

<br />

After you're done you'll come back to neobrutalism button page, and copy button component to your project inside `components/ui/button.tsx`
(this is the default component path) or your custom component path.

<br />

Keep in mind that neobrutalism components can have different variants than default shadcn components.

<br />

### Other components

If the shadcn docs link is not present on the component's page, just copy the component and read the instructions if there are any.
